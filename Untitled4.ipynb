I need to re-examine the structure based on the printed content and try a more flexible approach, possibly using regular expressions to find patterns that indicate module names and descriptions within the text, rather than just relying on splitting.

        "    *   It receives user actions from the UI.\n",
        "    *   It directs requests to the appropriate AI Processing components (e.g., sending files to Information Dismantling, sending user responses to the Interview Engine, sending queries/context to the AI Bot).\n",

        "    *   It manages the flow of data to and from the Data Storage Layer (saving verified data, retrieving data for display).\n",

        "    *   It provides context information to the AI Bot.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Data Storage Layer as Central Source of Truth:** All persistent case data resides here, securely siloed per case.\n",
        "    *   AI Processing components (after user verification) write refined data to Data Storage.\n",
        "    *   Modules read verified data from Data Storage to populate their interfaces.\n",
        "    *   The AI Bot can query Data Storage (via Application Logic) for contextual information.\n",
        "    *   This layer ensures data consistency and persistence across modules and AI interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Direct vs. Indirect Communication:**\n",

        "    *   The AI Bot has a more direct line for querying context and data via the Application Logic to provide real-time assistance, but actions that modify case data (via 'Checks and Balances') still go through the Application Logic and Data Storage for verification and persistence.\n",

        "4.  **API/Interface Design:** Internally, these layers and components would communicate via defined APIs or interfaces, ensuring modularity and allowing for updates to individual components without breaking the entire system. For example, the Data Storage Layer would expose methods like `save_fact(fact_data)`, `get_timeline(case_id)`, `add_entity(entity_data)`, while the AI Processing Layer might have methods like `process_files(file_list)`, `get_interview_questions(fact_id)`, `get_bot_response(context, query)`.\n",

        "    *   **[Dismiss]:** The Application Logic simply discards the suggestion. No changes are made to any module's data.\n",
        "    *   **[Save to Notes]:** The Application Logic takes the suggestion text and saves it as a private note associated with the current case or a specific element within a module (e.g., a note on a timeline event, an entity profile, or a document draft). This note is saved in the Data Storage Layer. The relevant module's interface (e.g., the Entity Profile view) might then be updated to show the new note.\n",
        "    *   **[+ Add to Case]:** This is the most impactful action. The Application Logic takes the structured data corresponding to the AI's suggestion (e.g., a verified fact object, a new entity profile with details). It then sends this data to the Data Storage Layer to be added to the official case record within the appropriate silo.\n",
        "5.  **Module Update:** After the data is successfully saved to Data Storage (for \"[+ Add to Case]\" or \"[Save to Notes]\"), the Application Logic signals the relevant module's UI to refresh its data display by retrieving the latest information from Data Storage.\n",
        "    *   *Example:* If a suggested fact is added, 'The Factual Record' module updates to show the new fact in the timeline.\n",

        "    *   **Priority 2:** Federal court websites (especially Fifth Circuit and Texas district courts), official U.S. legislative websites (for federal statutes).\n",
        "    *   **Priority 3:** Reputable legal information websites (e.g., Cornell's Legal Information Institute - LII, Justia - focusing on their Texas/Fifth Circuit sections), secondary sources like law reviews (used cautiously and flagged as secondary).\n",

            "**Approach:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Generate a Case-Specific Encryption Key:** When a new case is created, a unique, strong encryption key will be generated specifically for that case. This key will be used to encrypt all data within that case's silo.\n",
            "2.  **Key Management:** The case-specific encryption key itself must be protected.\n",
            "    *   It should *not* be stored in plain text on the device.\n",
            "    *   A common approach for mobile/desktop applications is to derive or encrypt this case key using a key derived from the user's authentication credentials (e.g., a password, PIN, or biometric authentication). This means the user must authenticate to unlock access to their case data.\n",
            "    *   Platform-specific secure storage (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager) should be used to store the encrypted case key or the key used to derive it.\n",
            "3.  **Data Encryption:**\n",
            "    *   All structured data (e.g., stored in a local database like SQLite) should be encrypted before being written to disk. Database encryption features (like SQLCipher for SQLite) are highly recommended.\n",
            "    *   All unstructured files (documents, images, etc.) should be encrypted using the case-specific key before being saved to the file system. Standard symmetric encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256) should be used.\n",
            "4.  **Decryption on Access:** When the application needs to access data for the currently open case, the user must authenticate to unlock the case key. This key is then used to decrypt the data read from the database or files before it is processed by the Application Logic or AI Processing layers.\n",
            "5.  **No Central Key Storage:** Crucially, no encryption keys should be stored on any central server. Keys are generated and managed *only* on the user's device, linked to their local authentication.\n",

            "2.  **Separate Storage Instances:**\n",
            "    *   **Structured Data:** Each case will have its own separate instance of the local database (e.g., a unique SQLite database file per case). This database file will store all the structured data for that specific case (timeline, entities, citations, etc.) and will be encrypted using the case's unique key.\n",

            "    *   Switching cases involves closing the current case's storage instances and key, and then opening the selected new case's instances and key after user authentication if required.\n",
            "4.  **No Cross-Linking:** Prevent any direct links or references between data entities stored in different case silos at the storage level. Relationships (e.g., linking an entity to a fact) should only exist *within* a single case silo.\n",

            "1.  **Code Compilation:** Compiling the application's source code for the specific target architecture (e.g., ARM for mobile, x86-64 for desktop).\n",
            "2.  **Asset Bundling:** Including all necessary assets such as UI resources (images, fonts, layout files), pre-trained AI models (if not downloaded separately), and the initial curated Knowledge Base data (Tier 2).\n",
            "3.  **Dependency Inclusion:** Packaging all required libraries and dependencies that are not assumed to be present on the target OS.\n",
            "4.  **Configuration:** Including application configuration files, potentially including initial settings or endpoints for update checks (if applicable).\n",
            "5.  **Signing:** Signing the application package with appropriate developer certificates for each platform (required for app stores and recommended for desktop distribution to ensure authenticity).\n",
            "6.  **Platform-Specific Formatting:** Creating the final distribution package in the format required by the platform (e.g., .ipa for iOS, .apk or .aab for Android, .exe installer for Windows, .dmg for macOS, .deb/.rpm/AppImage for Linux).\n",
            "7.  **Encryption/Obfuscation (Optional but Recommended):** Applying code obfuscation and potentially encrypting sensitive parts of the application code or assets to deter reverse engineering, especially for the AI models and curated knowledge base.\n",

            "4.  **Live Research Assistant (Tier 3):** The Live Research Assistant helps mitigate the issue of static data by providing access to current online sources. However, the *reliability* and *prioritization* of these sources (the \"Texas-First\" protocol logic) may also need occasional updates if websites change or new authoritative sources become available.\n",
            "5.  **User Notification:** Inform users when the Knowledge Base has been updated, potentially highlighting significant changes that might affect their understanding of legal procedures.\n",
            "6.  **Legal Disclaimer Reinforcement:** Each time the Knowledge Base is updated, it's an opportunity to reinforce the 'Red Line' disclaimer that the information is for educational purposes and not a substitute for legal advice from a qualified attorney.\n",
            "7.  **Community Contributions (with Review):** As an open-source project, consider allowing community contributions to the Knowledge Base, but implement a very strict review and verification process by legal experts before integrating any changes.\n",

        "\n",
        "*   **Comprehensive Module Outlines:** Detailed outlines for the Factual Record, Evidence Locker, Legal Intelligence, Litigation & Drafting, Post-Filing Management, and the 'Red Line' Disclaimer were successfully created, defining their UI components, functionalities, and technical considerations.\n",
        "*   **AI Integration Strategy Defined:** The integration of Information Dismantling, the Interview Engine, and the Context-Aware AI Bot with the modules was clearly described, emphasizing the flow of verified data via the Application Logic and Data Storage layers. The \"Checks and Balances\" system's role in user-controlled data modification was also outlined.\n",
        "*   **Three-Tiered Knowledge Base Structure:** A detailed structure for the legal knowledge base was defined, including the Foundation (Tier 1), Specialized Knowledge Base (Tier 2 - Texas/Federal law, forms, procedures), and Live Research Assistant (Tier 3). The implementation of the \"Texas-First\" protocol and the automated Citations & Sources Library was described.\n",
        "*   **Secure On-Device Data Storage Plan:** A plan for secure on-device data storage was developed, focusing on case-specific encrypted silos, unique encryption keys per case, key management linked to user authentication, and secure data access methods. The process for secure case export with user-defined password encryption was also detailed.\n",
        "*   **Supporting Feature Designs:** UI, user flow, and technical implementation outlines were created for the AI Counsel Persona Selector, Focus & Wellness Mode, Export Full Case File, Redaction & Sharing Tool, and Jurisdiction & Court Selector. The impact of the Jurisdiction Selector on AI behavior and Knowledge Base access was highlighted.\n",
        "*   **Comprehensive Test Plan:** A detailed test plan was generated, covering various testing types (Unit, Integration, System, Security, Performance, Legal Accuracy, UAT), sample test cases for all major features, specific success criteria, and a structured testing process including legal expert review and UAT.\n",
        "*   **Deployment and Maintenance Plan:** A plan for deployment and ongoing maintenance was established, outlining distribution channels (app stores, installers), packaging, maintenance activities (bug tracking, security monitoring, testing), update delivery strategies (app store updates, in-app updates, delta updates), user support mechanisms (in-app help, website, community forum), and the crucial process for updating the legal Knowledge Base.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Prioritize the development of the core modules and the secure data storage implementation as they form the foundational structure for the entire application and its privacy guarantees.\n",
        "*   Begin curating and structuring the Tier 2 Knowledge Base content for Texas and Federal law and procedures concurrently with module development, as the AI's utility heavily depends on this data."
